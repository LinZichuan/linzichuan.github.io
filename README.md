# Zichuan Lin (林子钏)

I'm a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University, supervised by Professor Guangwen Yang. I interned at Microsoft Research Asia from Sep. 2016 to Mar. 2018 (advised by [Lintao Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lintaoz/)) and from May 2018 to Jun. 2019 (advised by [Tao Qin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Li Zhao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lizo/)). My research interests include:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Imitation Learning
- Meta Learning
