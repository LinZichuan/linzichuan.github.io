Hi! I am Zichuan Lin, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Guangwen Yang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224195554390212530/20101224195554390212530_.html). 

I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia from Sep, 2016 to Mar, 2018 (advised by [Lintao Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lintaoz/)) and from May, 2018 to Jun, 2019 (advised by [Tao Qin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Li Zhao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lizo/)). I will be joining [SAIL](https://ai.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University as a visiting student researcher this Summer, advised by [Prof. Tengyu Ma](https://ai.stanford.edu/~tengyuma/).

My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning and meta learning. My goal is to develop sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, my research projects mainly involve episodic control, representation learning, distributional RL and multi-task RL.
