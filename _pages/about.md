Hi! I am Zichuan Lin, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Guangwen Yang.

I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia from Sep, 2016 to Mar, 2018 (advised by Lintao Zhang) and from May, 2018 to Jun, 2019 (advised by Tao Qin and Li Zhao). I will be joining SAIL at Stanford University as a visiting student researcher this Summer, advised by Prof. Tengyu Ma.

My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning and meta learning. My goal is to develop sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, my research projects mainly involve episodic control, representation learning, distributional RL and multi-task RL.
